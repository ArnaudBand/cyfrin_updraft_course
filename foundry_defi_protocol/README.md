1. Relative Stablility: Anchored or Pegged -> $1.00
  - Chainlink Price feed.
  - Set a function to exchange ETH & BTC -> $$
2. Stability Mechanism (Minting): Algorithmic (Decentralized)
  - People can only mint the stablecoin with enough collateral
3. Collateral: Exogenous (Crypto)
  - wETH
  -  wBTC

    * calculate health factor function
    * set health factor if debt is 0
    * Added a bunch of view functions

1. What are our invariants/properties?

1. Some proper oracle use 
2. Write more tests
3. Smart contract Audit Preparation
